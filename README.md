# CoGe Python API

The CoGePy API wraps the CoGe (www.genomevolution.org) API with native Python classes and methods to allow easier
interaction with the services.

For examples, see docs/examples.ipynb

CoGePy is in pre-release, and should not be expected to be fully stable. Changes may occur without prior notice.
